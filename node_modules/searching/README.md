# Searching
Search for occurrences of a specific word or phrase within a file. It returns array of sentences, that contain the word.

##About
This module performs reading a text file line by line. On collecting 6 lines, the module start performing regex operation in order to find sentences, that contain a word defined by the user. When the file ends or when the limit is passed, the module will return the result to the callback.

##Example use
```
  var searching = require('searching')    
  searching.word('Aristoteles', 5, 'testFile.txt', '../../', function(data){
    console.log(data) //=>['first sentence with Aristoteles inside','...']
  })  
```

##API

###.word(wordToBeSearched, limit, pathToTextFile, pathToRootDir, callback)

####wordToBeSearched
It could be a word or a phrase. It is included inside regex rule, so in case that you include special symbols, then you need to exclude them properly.
The rule is **/[\.\?\!]{1}(\s|\n){1,}?[^\.\?\!]+(phrase)[^\.\?\!]*./gm**

####limit
Define how many sentences you want back.

####pathToTextFile
Path of the text file. It is relative to place where you start the *Node.js* process.

####pathToRootDir
Path to the root directory of the project. It is relative to place where you start the *Node.js* process. If you start the process from the root directory, then the value is **''**. In the example case above, both paths are different.

###callback
Returns array of sentences. No error handling, as neither of the dependent modules propagate errors.
